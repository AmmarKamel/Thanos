# Thanos
A simple project to remove half the files in a given folder.

The project uses 2 libraries :
1- random : used for determining which files to delete randomly
2- os : used for interacting with directories and files

The idea is to make a list of all the files in the directory "Universe" and then getting a random index using the random library and make use of that list to delete the random file using the os library.
